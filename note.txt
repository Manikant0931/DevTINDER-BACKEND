we have added some notes here.
we added in package.json file.
what we added is?
=> we added a new script to run the application in development mode.
Your scripts (what they actually mean)
"scripts": {
  "dev": "nodemon app.js",
  "start": "node app.js"
}
Think of scripts as shortcuts with meaning.
🔹 npm run dev — DEVELOPMENT MODE
npm run dev

Runs:
nodemon app.js

What this gives you 👇
Watches your files 👀
You change code → save → server auto restarts
No Ctrl+C again and again
Fast debugging
Perfect while building & learning
